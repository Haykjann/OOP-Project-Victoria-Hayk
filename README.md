This game is a text based monopoly game.

If a player goes bankrupt, then he/she loses the game

There are 4 checkpoints, at location 0, 8, 16, 24.
By stepping at 0 the player receives $200 as a reward
By stepping at 8 the player receives $50 as a charge
By stepping at 16 the player receives $100 as a reward
By stepping at 24 the player receives $50 as a charge

There are 28 properties
After buying one the player can upgrade it from level 0 up to 4
An upgrade costs the 40% of the property's price. An upgrade increases property's worth by 20%

A player does not have to pay anything if he/she steps on his/her own property or an non-owned property

If a player steps on other player's property he/she must pay the rent which is 10% of the property's price at the moment

The features this games lack:
Chance square: It would be very interesting, however very time consuming. I was planning to use a pattern class which would get the chance cards from a text file and store in itself, so I would create another "Chance" class using pattern
Mortgage: A crucial feature, however I was short on time
